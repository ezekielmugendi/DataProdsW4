## Intro

This simple app shows us the effect of chosing the wrong number of clusters in the performance of the k-means algorithm. 

## How to Use

Move the slider to choose the number of clusters.
K-means will run with the selected number of clusters and a scatter plot will appear.
The plot at the bottom is using the real labels for comparison.
